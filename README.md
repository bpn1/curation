# react-template
A simple react template using MaterialUI

This project uses the yarn package manager instead of npm. You can install it by executing:

    npm install -g yarn
    
or by using brew on macOS:

    brew update
    brew install yarn
    
After you installed yarn you can setup the project by running `yarn` in the root directory.

You can begin developing by running the wepack-dev-server using the command:

    npm run dev
    
The template will be served under http://localhost:8080
